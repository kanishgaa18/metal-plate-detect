def find_plate_dimensions(image_path, known_plate_width_cm):
    """
    Detects the dimensions of a rectangular metal plate in an image.

    This function reads an image, preprocesses it to isolate the metal plate,
    finds the plate's contour, and then calculates its real-world dimensions
    based on a known reference dimension (the plate's own width) for calibration.
    The dimensions are returned in centimeters.

    Args:
        image_path (str): The path to the image file containing the metal plate.
        known_plate_width_cm (float): The known physical width of the plate
                                     in centimeters. This is used for calibration.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the width and height of the plate in centimeters
               (width_cm, height_cm). Returns None if the plate is not detected.
